## Hi there
![20088502](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117674807/217290992-5bd87b30-90e2-40bb-9c58-67b70731a4c4.png)


## :rocket: About me

I am Joan Vendrell, a Data Analyst once I get the certified for the full-time intense Bootcamp with advanced Data Analytics at Ironhack. Before that, I was a financial manager in a IT company after finishing my Bachelors in Business Administration and Management at University of Barcelona.

I describe myself as a data lover once I met them and I learnt from them. It is a genuine relationship, it is a relationship that you know that it won't lie, because as I learnt from my great teacher Jan Molendijk, data is data.
 
My goal is keep working with data, for that reason, I am currently looking for exciting opportunities where I can use my experience and skill set. 

If you have a new project to share, or just want to get to know me, send me a message on email. I look forward to speaking with you.
